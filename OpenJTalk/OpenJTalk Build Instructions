[OpenJTalk Build Instructions]

1. HTS Engine Build and Installation
The HTS Engine is a required dependecy of OpenJTalk.

a. Download and unpack the source and cd into the file.
b. Run: % ./configure
c. Run: % make
d. Run with elevated permissions: % sudo make install

*Note*
As of version 1.09 of the hts-engine, it appears that the files are built
under the directory /usr/local/ and does not create a separate folder to
house the hts-engine. To fix, adjust the directories accordingly or else
OpenJTalk will not run correctly during the make process.
(Hence yielding the hts-engine.h not found error...)

2. OpenJTalk Build and Installation
a. Run the following command with the proper configuration parameters.
   % ./configure \
     --with-hts-engine-header-path=/usr/local/hts_engine_API/include \
     --with-hts-engine-library-path=/usr/local/hts_engine_API/lib \
     --with-charset=UTF-8
b. Run: % make
c. Run with elevated permissions: % sudo make install
